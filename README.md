# AI Tutor (JavaScript)

**AI Tutor (JavaScript)** is a Proof of Concept (PoC) Android application developed as part of the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025 project.

This app showcases how the [Catrobat AI Tutor SDK](https://github.com/Catrobat/catrobat-ai-tutor) can be integrated into a JavaScript coding environment. It provides a lightweight code editor and execution environment for JavaScript programs (with support for the [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) game framework).

Users can write JavaScript code, run it directly inside the app, and interact with their preferred AI assistant (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) to ask questions, debug issues, or get guidance in a seamless workflow.
